## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **MeetingCard**: Display meeting information and controls
- **CreateMeetingModal**: Form for creating new meetings
- **ZoomVideoSDK**: Video calling interface
- **RecordingsList**: Display and manage recordings

### Backend Services
- **zoom-api.ts**: Zoom API integration and JWT generation
- **openai.ts**: OpenAI Whisper integration for transcription
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for all operations

### Key Technologies
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **Zoom Video SDK**: In-browser video calling
- **Zoom REST API**: Meeting management
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Audio transcription
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- JWT tokens are generated server-side with proper expiration
- Meeting passwords and URLs are handled securely
- File downloads are processed server-side to protect credentials

## Limitations and Notes

- Recordings may take a few minutes to appear after meetings end
- Transcription requires audio/video files (MP4, M4A formats)
- Large files may take longer to transcribe
- Free Zoom accounts have limited cloud recording storage
- OpenAI API usage will incur costs based on audio duration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create meeting"**
   - Check your Zoom API credentials
   - Ensure your Zoom app has the required scopes
   - Verify your account has meeting creation permissions

2. **"Failed to join meeting"**
   - Check your Zoom SDK credentials
   - Ensure your domain is allowlisted in the SDK app
   - Check browser permissions for camera/microphone

3. **"No recordings found"**
   - Ensure cloud recording is enabled for the meeting
   - Wait a few minutes after the meeting ends
   - Check your Zoom account's recording settings

4. **"Transcription failed"**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits
   - Check that the recording file is accessible
